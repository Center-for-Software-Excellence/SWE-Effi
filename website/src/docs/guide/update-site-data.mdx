## Overview

Updating the public leaderboard involves three stages:

1. **Collect raw statistics**
2. **Copy and normalize raw data**
3. **Generate chart- and leaderboard-ready data**

## 1. Collect raw statistics

Place the JSON outputs produced by the benchmark run in the following locations:

```
benchmark/results/agent-scaffold-stats/<scaffold-name>/<model-name>-combined_stats.json
```

```
benchmark/results/agent-scaffold-stats/<scaffold-name>/<model-name>-summary_stats.json
```

> Replace `<scaffold-name>` and `<model-name>` with the exact _scaffold_ and _model_ indentifiers used during the run

## 2. Copy & normalize the raw data

From the repository root, execute:

```bash
python scripts/transform_benchmark.py
```

The script:

- Copies the files listed above into `website/public/data/benchmark/raw/`

- Normalizes filenames and directory structure so that the next step can locate them.

## 3. Generate chart & leaderboard data

Go to the `website` directory and run the build script:

```bash
cd website
npm run generate-data
```

This command processes the raw files and writes the derived datasets to:

`website/public/data/chart/` and `website/public/data/table`

Both the interactive charts and the leaderboard tables are regenerated automatically using the newly generated data.
